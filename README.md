# Mentoring App

## Introduction

The goal is to build a mentoring app that will allow end-users looking for mentoring to connect with experienced mentors.

## MVP

- There will be two types of user account: Mentor and Mentee
- Users can log in (No authentication initially, just simple log in)
- Mentors and Mentees will be able to create and edit their own user profile.
- Mentors and Mentees can delete their account.
- Mentees can view a list of all available mentors
- Mentors can toggle on/off to mark whether they are currently accepting new mentees/bookings

## Extensions

- Mentees can filter mentors to more easily find mentors who have specific expertise (e.g. software development or design)
- Mentors can see a list of their mentees, and mentees can see a list of their mentors.

## Advanced Extensions

- Mentees can contact mentors via the platform to request mentoring.
- Users can import profile information from LinkedIn API
